## Kanastra Technical Challenge

### Thank you!

First of all, I would like to thank you for the oppotunity to showcase my hard skills. This challenge made challenge myself in learning new technologies that I will certainly apply in other projects.

The weekend was tough to me as I had many commitments so technically I had something around 2.5 days to complete it, but I glad I could deliver this in time.

### My requests to you

1. Please, if you encounter any issues or anything like this, don't hesitate in communicating to me. I hope you don't need to, that's why I created tests, but if you do encounter any issues, let me know. I will be glad to help.
2. Read the READMEs (LOL). I spent some time writing them in order to explain my technical thinking and how I approached some tough situation. It might help you to understand how I work technically speaking.
3. Enjoy experimenting with this.
